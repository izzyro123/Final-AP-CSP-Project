          <p>For my AP Biology class, we had to do a project about African Elephants. We researched a group of elephants from a specific area in Africa and learned about their habitats and their relationship to their environment as a "keystone species". This research was important to help us understand how crucial it is that elephant populations stay strong, and how their ecosystems may suffer if they become further endangered from poaching practices and habitat destruction. I created a slideshow and a Flipgrid video summarizing my research and what I had learned.</p></td>

          <p>For my AP Calculus AB class, we are currently working on a cumulative end-of-year project that encompasses many of the topics that we have covered in the class. We were assigned nine different topics that we had to create our own problems for, and then we had to show how we would solve them and provide solutions. My partner and I decided to combine all of our work into a slideshow by topic, so that it could be used to easily showcase what we have learned. This project was a great way for me to review the topics that we have covered this year and prepare me for college-level calculus.
