    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img class="image" src = "https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/V-Cat-Color.jpg">
    <p class="p">My name is Izzy Rosselli and I am a senior at Piedmont High School. Next year, I am going to attend the University of Vermont as a Biology and Political Science double major. Currently, I live with my mom, dad, and older brother in Piedmont and my older sister lives in Oakland. In my free time, I like hiking, rock climbing, and eating burritos.
